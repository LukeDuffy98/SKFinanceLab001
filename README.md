# SK Finance AI Training — Student repo

Welcome! This repo is your hands-on workspace for the SK Finance AI training.

You’ll complete short, practical labs that mirror real NBFC workflows (KYC checks, call analysis, and customer communications) — using **synthetic** (fake) data only.

## Start here (5 minutes)

1. Redeem your lab account (username/password).
2. Open Lab 1 and follow the steps exactly.
3. Keep your notes private (they may contain credentials).

## Redeem Lab Access (get your lab username + password)

Open this page:

- https://quillmsexamprep.z8.web.core.windows.net/Creds.html

On the page:

1. In **Identifier**, type **your name** (the name you were given for the lab).
2. Select **Submit**.
3. In **Result**, copy the values shown for **LAB Username** and **LAB Password**.
4. Keep this page open (you will use these details to sign in).

## Labs (do these in order)

1. Lab 1 — KYC document verification (Document Intelligence + Vision)
	- What you achieve: extract key KYC fields from a synthetic ID image, interpret confidence scores, and decide what needs manual review.
	- Start: [labs/01-kyc-document-verification/README.md](labs/01-kyc-document-verification/README.md)
2. Lab 2 — Call analysis and grievance automation
	- What you achieve: analyze a synthetic customer call transcript to identify intent, extract key details, and draft a structured grievance record for follow-up.
	- Start: [labs/02-call-analysis-and-grievance-automation/README.md](labs/02-call-analysis-and-grievance-automation/README.md)
3. Lab 3 — Comms templates (SMS + email)
	- What you achieve: generate consistent customer-ready message drafts from templates, with safety checks and clear “human approval required” guardrails.
	- Start: [labs/03-comms-templates-sms-email/README.md](labs/03-comms-templates-sms-email/README.md)

## Demo (optional)

If your facilitator asks you to run the demo locally:

- Loan decision mini-app: [demos/04-loan-decision-miniapp/README.md](demos/04-loan-decision-miniapp/README.md)

## Compliance / safety (RBI-aligned)

- Use **synthetic** content only. Do not upload real PAN, Aadhaar, or any customer documents.
- Treat credentials and extracted fields as sensitive. Do not share screenshots or paste them into chat.
- Follow facilitator instructions for access, regions, and cleanup.
